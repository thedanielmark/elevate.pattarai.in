            All attendees, speakers, sponsors, vendors, partners, Pattarai staff
            and volunteers at Pattarai Virtual Event and any related events are
            required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct. Event
            organizers will enforce this code throughout the event’s entirety.
            Before a Virtual Society Meeting, all participants are expected to
            be familiar with this policy. Participants must register for a
            Virtual Meeting and provide an email, text, phone or (for special
            needs) other contacts where they can be reached during the Virtual
            Meeting. Registration constitutes consent to audio and visual
            recording (and use and alteration of the recording) by the Pattarai
            at the Meeting for non-commercial purposes aligned with the
            Society’s mission. Failure to register, provide such contact, or be
            available via the contact provided is grounds for being disconnected
            from the Virtual Meeting at the participant’s cost, without further
            notice or process. Our aim in hosting a virtual Pattarai event is to
            build a stronger community. Our goal is to create an environment
            where everyone feels welcome to participate, speak up, ask
            questions, and engage in conversation. This requires a
            harassment-free and inclusive environment that recognizes the
            inherent worth of every participant. We invite all those who
            participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for
            everyone. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free
            environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
            expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack
            thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
            Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate during any aspect of
            this virtual event/conference, including talks, workshops, parties,
            social media such as Twitter, or other online media. Following a
            Code of Conduct allows Pattarai to create the best experience
            possible for all attendees.
            <br /> <br />
            <strong>Expected Behaviour</strong> <br />
            Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
            Attempt collaboration before conflict. Refrain from demeaning,
            discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your
            surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert Pattarai staff if
            you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations
            of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. During
            this virtual event or any of its related events, no participant
            should engage in harassment in any form. Do not disrupt the virtual
            meeting (e.g., “zoom-bombing”) or engage in harm or threats of harm
            of any kind. Do not create/contribute to a safety threat or unsafe
            or exclusionary situation. Do not make audio or visual recordings of
            the Virtual Meeting in any medium—and do not distribute audio or
            visual recordings of the Virtual Meeting (via social media or any
            other means). Only Pattarai or its representatives may do so, after
            warning participants to allow them to opt-out. Do not take or
            distribute pictures of or copy research posters/presentation
            materials unless explicit permission is granted. Participants
            violating these rules may be expelled from without a refund at the
            discretion of Pattarai. Participants asked to stop any harassing
            behavior are expected to comply immediately.

            <strong> Note About Differences of Opinion and Offense</strong>{" "}
            <br />
            To achieve the purposes of a virtual event in the limited time
            provided, with the universal benefit of all participants’ being
            fully engaged, discussions should be focused on the meeting topic at
            hand. All participants must be able and welcome to equitably and
            effectively participate. It is not a violation of the
            conference Conduct Policy to express an opinion, raise research or
            describe an experience (“articulation”) that is at odds with the
            opinions of or is offensive to others—if the articulation is part of
            an on-point discussion of the Virtual Society Meeting topic at hand
            and is offered in a manner that does not interfere with others’
            reasonable ability and welcome to participate fully. That means
            expressing differing positions with respect and consideration for
            all, in a manner that reflects intellectual rigour and is
            demonstrably mindful of minimizing, as reasonably possible, its
            potential adverse effect on others’ ability to participate.
            (Offering a warning of the potential for impact on others
            is one way to demonstrate such respect and consideration for all.)
            It also means not making an articulation that is reasonably expected
            to cause offence gratuitously (i.e., unrelated or unnecessary for
            the work on that topic). It a not directing the articulation as
            a personal attack or put-down of an individual, and not dominating
            the discussion. It further means demonstrating consideration for
            anyone who appears to be in distress by promptly stopping the cause
            and demonstrating caring, while still pursuing a way to share
            pertinent information, with the Society moderator’s assistance if
            needed. Reporting an incident:
            <br />
            <br /> If you see, overhear or experience a violation of the Code of
            Conduct during a virtual event, and would like to report a
            violation, you please email us at <a href="mailto:elevate@pattarai.in">elevate@pattarai.in</a> <br />
