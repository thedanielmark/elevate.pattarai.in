                      One nanometer is 10<sup>-9</sup> meter, or a millionth of
                      a millimeter. Can you imagine the devices fabricated at
                      such a small dimensional scale? Your crazy fast Ryzen or
                      that NVMe you’re rocking? Newer nanofabrication and
                      lithography processes open the door to super-high-density
                      microprocessors and memory chips. Exciting?

                      Application development has been constantly evolving with
                      new frameworks, development tools, AI and analytics, etc.
                      Trends have greatly changed with the introduction of new
                      hardware, hardware with new form factors and even hardware
                      that never existed before! We’d love to know the best
                      practices you follow to be an efficient app developer and
                      how you can put the newly available tools and frameworks
                      to work!
